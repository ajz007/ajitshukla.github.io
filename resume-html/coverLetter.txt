Hello there,
Young, enthusiastic and ownership driven full stack developer with a strong experience in banking and capital markets. Currently working as a Scrum Master and individual contributer in a fast paced agile environment for a 'equity options trading clearing house' product in Nasdaq.
I have worn several hats like developer, tech lead, engineering manager and  solutions architect which shows that I am very agile and happy to fit in any role as long as I am learning :)
